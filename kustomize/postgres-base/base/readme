This is the desired base for all CN Postgresql installation in Anthos.

overlays should be used to kustomize for specific database clusters.

Kustomizations in the base:

Default cluster name is: postgres
Deploy in HA mode with 2 replicas.
Annotations for centralized Prometheus
Default is backup daily at midnight with 7 day retention.
Centralized logging instead of postgres.log
Super user, postgres, has secret exposed in k8s secret for the cluster.
Monitoring data is exported.

Todo: setup standard CN configuration generic id for Ansible Playbook.
